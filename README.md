***********************************

## This script has an interactive beginning and will ask for the following information :

- Server Name (You can enter )(Example)): example.com or your ip of your vps like this 80.41.52.63)
- Are you using a subdomain (subdomain.example.com)
- Enter support email
- Set stratum to AutoExchange

- Install Fail2ban
- Install UFW and configure ports
- Install LetsEncrypt SSL

***********************************

Finish! Remember to 
```
sudo reboot
```
when the installer tell you to.

- Access your new pool at (No-SSL) example.com/site/      (With SSL) https://www.example.com/site/
- Access AdminPanel: (No-SSL) example.com/site/AdminPanel (With SSL) https://www.example.com/site/AdminPanel


### Update keys.php if you have exchange (Enable)

- > Update your public keys for exchanges (If Enable). update with Your own keys.. , you can change it by nano to,
```
sudo nano /etc/yiimp/keys.php
```
### Change AdminRights

- > **If you want change your AdminRights to something else :** Edit this file "/SiteController.php" and Line 11 => change 'AdminPanel'

```
sudo nano /var/web/yaamp/modules/site/SiteController.php
```
###### :bangbang: **IMPORTANT** : 

- The configuration of yiimp and coin require a minimum of knowledge in linux
- Your mysql information (login/Password) is saved in **~/.my.cnf**

*****************************************************************************

While I did add some server security to the script, it is every server owners responsibility to fully secure their own servers. After the installation you will still need to customize your serverconfig.php file to your liking, add your API keys, and build/add your coins to the control panel.
